- **making-change.py**: Breaks a dollar amounbt into quarters, dimes, and pennies using the greedy algorithm
- **pythagorean-triplets.py**: Computes all Pythagorean triples from 0 to n (0 < a,b,c <= n)
- **quadratic-solver.py**: Solves and plots quadratic equations
- **salary-calculator.py**: Determines the weekly salary of an employee, including overtime and bonus
- **tuple-input.py**: Inputting tuples (making sure input matches expected output types) from user and from cars.csv
- **pythagorean-triplets2.py**: Computes all Pythagorean triples from 0 to n (0 < a,b,c <= n) using 1 list comprehension
- **reading-csv.py**: Reading and manipulating a csv file, without using pythons built in csv module

## TODO: 
- first pythag is broken, algorithm is wrong
- add comments and error catching to most of them
